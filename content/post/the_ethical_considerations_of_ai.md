I'm not sure if this is something I should write about. I have chosen a career in tech, and I love it, but my views on AI may be somewhat controversial for a developer. But what’s the point of having a blog about my thoughts if I can’t or won’t express my actual opinions? So here we go, I guess.

I don’t think it’s ethically or morally justified to use AI for most of what we’re using it for today.

There. I said it. Felt like swearing in church, to be honest.

The development of AI and large language models we’ve seen the past year is amazing.\
Truly, it’s a revolution.

But it happens so fast. Too fast. I don’t think we’re prepared or able to comprehend the ramifications of this escalating pace of development.

What does AI usage actually cost? There are many free resources readily available to use, so for me personally, it’s mostly free. And it’s good. Like, really good. I was mind blown by chatGPT when it became available. A couple of weeks ago I tried ClaudeAI and once again - mind blown. Especially when it comes to coding. I’m amazed, and I only have a free account with limited prompts, but it goes a long way and the quality is great. It’s so easy, it almost feels magical.  \
\
But, as you probably know, nothing in this world is free and magic is an illusion.  \
\
I have so many thoughts on the subject of AI that I barely know where to start. There are so many considerations to keep in mind, and it’s on such a large scale, and it’s affecting our world on so many levels, and I don’t have answers. Just questions.  \
\
What about the environmental impact?

What about the social impact?

What about the societal impact?  \


Data centers require tons of energy to keep cool. Electricity and water. Increasingly powerful hardware. With increasing climate change, can we justify this use of resources?

People need to practice to learn. People need to learn how to value information. How will AI affect our next generations learning ability?

Our society is built on people working for a living. What happens when entire job sectors vanishes?\
\
I’m also concerned about how we are training our models. They need to be trained with real data, but real data reflects our reality. Since we do not live in a perfect society, unfortunately this  means the data is full of biases, harmful stereotypes and dysfunctional institutional practices.

If we’re not careful, we risk building these biases into our models, cementing them further, which could and likely will have adverse effects on already marginalized people.  \


I’m not *against* AI. I think it’s a fantastic tool that can be used for many great things. I just don’t think we can justify using it to everything. Do we really need AI generated posts on social media? Do we really need AI-engineered advertisements? Do we need to use AI to make a shopping list or render images of cute animals? \
\
I think we’re very good at asking “can it be done?” and exceeding expectations. But maybe we should also start asking ourselves “should it be done?”  \
\
I don’t know. I don’t think anyone really knows at this point. So let’s end this post here, for now. To be continued.

I am a native Swedish speaker and I haven’t written much in english since university, so please forgive the errors. Hopefully, my writing will improve with regular practice. I’ve decided not to use AI to modify or enhance any posts in this blog.
