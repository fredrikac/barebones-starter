So I've been thinking about starting a blog for quite a while now. Writing down what I learn about software engineering and tech in general seems like a good idea. I could create a blog where I could write about mind bending concepts, cool tools and random thoughts. It could also be like a portfolio, showcasing my skills as a developer. I could make a project board to show how I work with issues, I could create a figma mockup and let you follow my process making this place look nice.

I've been thinking about this for maybe a year now and I have so many ideas. The problem is, when you have too many things in your head at once, it's really hard to start.

So I decided to put all my grand visions aside and just create an MVP.

So hello and welcome to my blog - I made it with TinaCMS, it's hosted at TinaCloud and I bought my (very first!) domain at Porkbun.
