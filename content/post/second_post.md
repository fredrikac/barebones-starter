title: The second post
---

Okay, so it's been a while. I haven't touched the computer at all during the holidays. I really needed the rest, and now I'm back and feeling slightly more energized.
Getting started is often a challenge, but I think it's way harder to keep going and just continue. The point of this blog is to practice just that. \
\
I haven't created that many projects since I started working as a developer, partly because I haven't had the energy to stay at the computer after working a full day in front of it, and partly because I can't decide what kind of project to commit to. But honestly - the biggest reason for not doing code projects is perfectionism. I've felt like I needed to have a clear vision of what to create before I could even start, that I need to think about every single aspect before making a decision, and that I need to do things The Best Way Possible from the beginning.

Can you relate? If so, how's that going for you?

\
Because it has not been going well for me. Not at all. Trying to think of and do everything right at the start is overwhelming, to say the least. An overwhelmed perfectionist with ambitions might have great ideas, but having ideas is not enough. You need to actually do something. Without having all the details ready. \
So here I am, doing it. Blog still looks kinda shit, but at least I've decided on Tailwind, installed and configured it and replaced all css-files with it. I've uploaded a font for my "brand", and I managed to choose one without getting stuck in the process (I set a timer on 10 minutes, googled "free fonts", found a list and made myself choose from only that list), and I don't hate it. It's called Mystic Sunlite, I found it on **[befonts](https://befonts.com/mystic-sunlite-font.html)** and it's free for personal use. Yay me!

Now, let's keep this up for a bit. To be continued...
