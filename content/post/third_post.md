So I've changed the header and added a sidebar menu on the posts page. The look has kind of an early 2000's first wordpress blog vibe, but at least there's a layout now. I want to create a color palette and add some accents, and maybe som graphic elements to make it less bland.\
\


I'd like to add categories or tags to posts too. I want to write about what I learn here, so TIL (Today I learned) could be the first. But, one step at the time. Slow and steady. I don't want to fall into the trap of trying to fix everything all at once and then losing interest because it's too overwhelming.\
\
I'll start with what I learned (or was reminded of yesterday): not taking breaks while coding is stupid. Staring at the editor until frustration boils in my veins and I feel like throwing the computer out the window is neither productive nor efficient. Ignoring my timer\* because I'm in a flow state is not a good idea, even if it feels super annoying to pause when I'm in the zone. I need breaks. My brain need breaks. Trying to force solutions when tired and frustrated just doesn't work.\
\
I know this. I still forget it often enough that I need reminders. So here's one, to me, and to you, dear reader: you need breaks. Don't skip them. They're important even if it doesn't feel like that at the time. Not taking breaks won't make you more productive.\
\
\*I set my phone timer on 30-45 minutes for focused work and then 5-15 minutes for breaks.
