title: Will AI take my job?

Tl;dr: No, I don't think so, but yes, I am a little bit worried. \
\
AI is superior when it comes to setting up new projects. Not having to google every single part of the setup, not having to manually configure every package is a huge time saver - especially for developers like me, who has been working at a product company  since graduation. I’ve been here since 2022 (a little over two years) and I still haven’t had to set up a new project. 

I did my internship here, so I went from creating projects for school assignments to work in existing code bases. That’s a different skill set. \
\
I noticed how bad I am at setting up new projects during a code interview. That was not fun, to say the least, and my confidence took a hit. I also noticed how copilot can make me sloppy - when I’m tired, or stressed, or frustrated, I tend to skip the reading-and-considering-the-suggestions-part and just accept them, in some futile attempt to solve the problem faster. \
\
This is obviously not a good strategy, and no, it does not solve the issue faster (rather the opposite).\
\
AI is an incredibly useful tool for new projects, especially simple ones like this website. I’ve used claudeAI and github copilot (you can check out the repo on github), and it’s been easy and fun and fast.

But, when working in bigger repositories, I find AI to be less useful. It’s still a great tool, but as the complexity and size of the code base grows, it offers less and less help in finding and solving bugs, and it’s not a given that copilot can implement new features in an existing structure. \
\
People don’t write perfect code. Not all solutions are created by best practices. The code in an older code base is probably not written by one person, but many, with different backgrounds, different levels of experience and different ways of thinking. Some solutions will be surprisingly creative (a.k.a. crappy) and some solutions will be on a level of abstraction that does not exist in tutorials or textbooks, only in the brains of great coders.\


Some functions might be remains of older code that hasn’t been removed for some reason (usually the developer implemented new functionality to replace it and then forgot do remove the old stuff). You can’t rely on comments, because there probably won’t be any, and if there are, they might not explain that much anyway. There are dependencies, and integrations to other systems, which has its own limitations that you cannot affect, and work-arounds that were meant to be temporary but became a constant part of the applications scaffolding. \
\
You need to understand the problem to write a good prompt in order to get anything helpful out of AI. If you can’t code, how are you going to articulate the problem? Understanding a concept while reading it is one thing, identifying a problem caused by a faulty implementation in a real situation is a whole new ballgame. It’s even more difficult if the problem is nested through different levels of the application. Sure, you can prompt the AI assistant to scan through your workspace, but results can and will vary. \
\
So, do I think AI will replace me? \
\
No, not entirely - but work will probably look quite different in a couple of years. The models are getting better and faster every day, and the limitations mentioned above might soon be history. I learned how to code without AI, and I’m grateful for that, because I needed the practice to understand the concepts, and I don’t think I could have resisted the easy way of asking an AI to just provide the solution. I’m a decent enough developer, and I have more qualities than just being able to write code, so I’m fairly confident in my future in tech. \
\
I feel worried for the students entering the tech field now though, because it's really difficult to get a job as a newcomer, and I think it will get increasingly harder.\
Why hire a junior and pay a salary when the simpler tasks can be handled by AI? But if we don’t hire any new people, there will soon be a huge shortage of experienced senior engineers. You don’t get seniors without investing in juniors, and there really isn’t any shortcuts to gain the knowledge and skills that comes out of experience.
