It’s a common misconception that CSS is the “easy part” of frontend development. It’s just makeup, right? How hard can it be?\
\
\
I kind of enjoy writing CSS. I like flexbox; thinking in vertical and horizontal boxes is oddly satisfying. I’ve worked with SASS, tailwind, and Material UI, mostly. And Bootstrap. Most of those were quite easy to pick up. They’re all based on CSS, so if you know the basics, it’s pretty straightforward. Except for when it isn’t. CSS in itself isn't that complex - but the implementations can be. \
\
\
It’s usually easier to look at code you wrote yourself than figuring out code written by another person (or multiple people). You might have written some shitty CSS, but you will recognize your own kind of stupid. Figuring out someone else’s kind of stupid is much harder. \
\
\
I feel like CSS is often the messiest part. Maybe it’s because it’s seen as “just cosmetics”? It’s also tightly connected to the (hopefully semantic) HTML-structure, so if the structure isn't solid, the CSS won't be either. \
\
\
And that’s where `border: solid 1px red` comes in. I feel kind of silly every time I write that particular line, but it’s actually pretty useful. Especially if you’re working with some framework or component library that hides the actual DOM-elements in styled components in the code. For example, the MUI-component Box is essentially a div, which can make it hard to locate the exact one you're looking for in the browser’s developer tools. Or if you’re trying to navigate a CSS-file with hundreds or thousands of lines, which might not be that common, but certainly does exist.\


I think the worst CSS I’ve ever looked at was when I customized the theme for my employer’s help desk software. To add custom styling, I had to dig through six thousand or so lines of CSS. I spent a day, maybe two, just adding hex-codes, padding and button styles. It was vanilla CSS on top of some old html-framework that I’ve never heard of before and never seen since. \
\
\
It felt ridiculous to spend that amount of time to change the look of some buttons, but I’ve come to realize that tasks like these are actually really good practice, and it’s ok that it takes time. It’s really hard to estimate tasks in development anyway, and there is no better way to learn than to dig into code.\
\
\
When I was an intern, I just assumed that when I didn’t understand something, or struggled to find a solution, it was because I was stupid a newbie and did not have sufficient skill. It did not occur to me that the code I was working with could be messy, unstructured, verbose, overly complicated and sometimes outright bad.\
\
Now, when I don’t immediately find the solution, I know it’s because the code is stupid, not me.\
\
\
Just kidding. I’m still stupid and/or ignorant sometimes. The difference is that I have a slightly more open mind, and now I know that the answer can be either. Or both. Usually a combination, with a sprinkle of inexperience, a dash of misunderstanding, a pinch of stress, a bit of thoughtlessness and sometimes just a plain lack of knowledge.\
\
\
That’s ok. I’m learning new things every day, and solving problems is just another skill to hone.\
\
So yeah. That’s all I have to say about `border: solid 1px red` (quite a lot, apparently).

It’s not stupid if it works, folks.
